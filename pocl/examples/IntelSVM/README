1) Download intel_ocl_svm_basic_win.zip from:
     https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-20-shared-virtual-memory-code-sample
   to this folder

3) reconfigure pocl ( ./configure ) with --enable-testsuites=check
   or --enable-testsuites=IntelSVM

5) call 'make prepare-examples' once to get the examples built
   Note: you need OpenCL 2.0 headers installed in your system for this
   step to succeed.
   
   You can install them from pocl via
   
     ./configure --enable-install-opencl-headers
     make -C include/CL install

6) run tests: make check
