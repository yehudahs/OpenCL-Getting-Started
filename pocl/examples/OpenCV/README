To enable the OpenCV tests:

1) run 
   'wget https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/archive/3.0.0-beta.zip -O opencv-3.0.0-beta.zip' 
   to download OpenCV

2) configure pocl, it should now detect the OpenCV benchmark and
   enable it. You need cmake to get it built.

   Also you might need to install the following libraries:
   VTK (libvtk6-dev)

3) call 'make prepare-examples' once to get the examples built

4) call 'make check TESTSUITEFLAGS="-k opencv"', it should build 
   the OpenCV cases and run the pocl test suite for the OpenCV.

Known issues:

The CMake of OpenCV doesn't like ccache, so if you have CXX='ccache g++-4.7'
you might need to prepare the example without the ccache in front. E.g.:

  make prepare-examples CXX=g++-4.7 CC=g++-4.7
