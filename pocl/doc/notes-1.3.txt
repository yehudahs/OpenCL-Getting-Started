Portable Computing Language (pocl) v1.3 released
-------------------------------------------------

Pocl is a portable open source (MIT-licensed) implementation of the OpenCL
standard (1.2 with some 2.0 features supported). In addition to being an
easily portable multi-device open-source OpenCL implementation, another major
goal of this project is improving performance portability of OpenCL programs
with the kernel compiler and the task runtime, reducing the need for
target-dependent manual optimizations.

Upstream pocl currently supports various CPU devices, NVIDIA GPUs via libcuda,
HSA-supported GPUs and TCE ASIPs (experimental, see http://openasip.org),
with various known private adopters as well.

Release Highlights
------------------

* Support for Clang/LLVM 8.0.
* Support ICD on OSX.
* A lot of major and minor bug fixes and internal code cleanups.

Notes
-----

* Support code for older than LLVM 6.0 will be removed in the beginning of
  the next release cycle to clean up the code base. If you care need support
  for older LLVM versions in the future pocl releases and wish to maintain
  it (run a buildbot and fix issues), let us know!
* Support for Vecmathlib has been removed.

Please note that there's an official pocl "maintenance policy" in place.
This text describes the policy and how you can get your favourite project
that uses OpenCL to remain regression free in the future pocl releases:
