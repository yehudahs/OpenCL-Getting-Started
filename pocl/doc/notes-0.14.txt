Portable Computing Language (pocl) v0.14 released
-------------------------------------------------

Pocl's goal is to become a performance portable open source (MIT-licensed)
implementation of the OpenCL standard. In addition to producing an easily
portable open-source OpenCL implementation, another major goal of this
project is improving performance portability of OpenCL programs with the
kernel compiler and the task runtime, reducing the need for target-dependent
manual optimizations.

Release highlights
------------------

* Support for LLVM/Clang 4.0 and 3.9.
* A new binary format containing the final executable bits, which enables
  running OpenCL programs on hosts without online compiler support.
* Initial support for out-of-order command queue task scheduling.
* A plenty of bugfixes also to some very long standing bugs.

Please note that there's now an official pocl maintenance policy in place.
This text describes the policy and how you can get your favourite project
that uses OpenCL to remain regression free in the future pocl releases:
