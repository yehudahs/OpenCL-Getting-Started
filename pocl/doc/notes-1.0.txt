Portable Computing Language (pocl) v1.0 released
-------------------------------------------------

Pocl is a portable open source (MIT-licensed) implementation of the OpenCL
standard (1.2 with some 2.0 features supported). In addition to producing an
easily portable open-source OpenCL implementation, another major goal of this
project is improving performance portability of OpenCL programs with the
kernel compiler and the task runtime, reducing the need for target-dependent
manual optimizations.

Release highlights
------------------

* Support for LLVM/Clang 5.0 and 4.0.
* Support for NVIDIA GPUs via a new CUDA backend (currently experimental)
* The OpenCL 1.2 conformance tests now pass with selected CPUs. There are some
  caveats though - see the documentation.

Please note that there's now an official pocl "maintenance policy" in place.
This text describes the policy and how you can get your favourite project
that uses OpenCL to remain regression free in the future pocl releases:
