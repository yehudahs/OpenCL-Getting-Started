Portable Computing Language (pocl) v1.5 released
------------------------------------------------

PoCL is a portable open source (MIT-licensed) implementation of the
OpenCL standard (1.2 with some 2.0 features supported). In addition to
being an easily portable multi-device open-source OpenCL implementation,
a major goal of this project is improving interoperability of diversity
of OpenCL-capable devices by integrating them to a single centrally
orchestrated platform.

Upstream PoCL currently supports various CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs via libcuda,
HSA-supported GPUs and TCE ASIPs (experimental, see:
http://openasip.org) It also is known to have multiple (private) ports.

Release Highlights
------------------

* Support for Clang/LLVM 10.0
* An easy to use kernel profiling feature
* Plenty of fixes and performance improvements

Please note that there's an official PoCL "maintenance policy" in place.
This text describes the policy and how you can get your favourite
project that uses OpenCL to remain regression free in the future PoCL
releases:
