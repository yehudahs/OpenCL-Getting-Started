<h1>March 9 2018: pocl v1.1 released</h2>

<h2>Release highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>Support for LLVM/Clang 6.0 and 5.0.</li>
<li>Experimental SPIR and SPIR-V support</li>
<li>Improved kernel compilation speed</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Please note that there's an official pocl maintenance policy in place.
<a href="http://portablecl.org/docs/html/maintainer-policy.html">This text</a>
describes the policy and how you can get your favourite project
that uses OpenCL to remain regression free in the future pocl releases.</p>

<p>We are looking for active maintainers to look after the ARM(64) and MacOS
ports. If you are interested in helping to keep pocl working well on these
platforms, please let us know!</p>
