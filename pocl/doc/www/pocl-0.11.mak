<h1>March 12th, 2015: pocl v0.11 released</h2>

<p>This release adds:
<ul>
<li>kernel compiler support for LLVM/Clang 3.6,
<li>caching of compiled OpenCL kernels
<li>initial Android support
<li>experimental Windows support (many things still broken there)
<li>two new examples, Cloverleaf and Halide, updated AMDSDK examples
<li>better debugging possibilities
<li>initial MIPS architecture support
</ul>

</p>

<p>
We consider pocl ready for wider scale testing, although the OpenCL
standard is not yet fully implemented, and it contains known bugs.
The pocl test suite compiles and runs most of the ViennaCL 1.5.1
examples, Rodinia 2.0.1 benchmarks, Parboil benchmarks, OpenCL
Programming Guide book samples, VexCL test cases, Luxmark v2.0,
most of the AMD APP SDK v2.9 OpenCL samples and piglit OpenCL tests
among others.</p>
