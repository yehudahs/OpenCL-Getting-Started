<h1>October 26th, 2015: pocl v0.12 released</h2>

<p>This release adds:
<ul>
<li> support for HSA-compliant devices (tested with AMD Kaveri's GPU)
    ( for installation steps & current status, please see the HSA section
     in <a href="http://www.portablecl.org/docs/html/hsa.html">Pocl documentation</a>)
<li> Little endian MIPS32 now passes almost all tests
<li> kernel compiler support for LLVM/Clang 3.7
<li> improved caching of compiled OpenCL kernels
</ul>
</p>

<p>
We consider pocl ready for wider scale testing, although the OpenCL
standard is not yet fully implemented, and it contains known bugs.
The pocl test suite compiles and runs most of the ViennaCL 1.5.1
examples, Rodinia 2.0.1 benchmarks, Parboil benchmarks, OpenCL
Programming Guide book samples, VexCL test cases, Luxmark v2.0,
most of the AMD APP SDK v2.9 OpenCL samples and piglit OpenCL tests
among others.
</p>

<p>
Note: 0.12 is the last version that builds with older LLVM versions.
We plan to prune code needed to support for the old versions in the
next release and focus on the current stable LLVM version and possibly
the previous one for easier transition.
