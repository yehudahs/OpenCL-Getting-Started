Portable OpenCL (pocl) v0.6 released
------------------------------------

Portable OpenCL aims to be an efficient open source (MIT-licensed) 
implementation of the OpenCL 1.2 standard. 

In addition to producing an easily portable open source OpenCL
implementation, another major goal of the project is improving 
performance portability of OpenCL programs with compiler 
optimizations, reducing the need for target-dependent manual 
optimizations. At the core of pocl is a set of LLVM passes 
used to statically parallelize multiple work-items with the kernel
compiler, even in the presence of work-group barriers. This enables 
parallelization of the fine-grained static concurrency in the work 
groups in multiple ways (SIMD, VLIW, superscalar,...).

The code base is modularized to allow easy adding of new "device drivers"
in the host-device layer. A generic multithreaded "target driver" is 
included. It allows running OpenCL applications on a host that supports 
the pthread library with multithreading at the work group granularity.

An optimized kernel library is provided for x86_64. The generic
unoptimized (no instruction set extensions used) version has been 
successfully tested with an ARMv7 CPU under MeeGo, and with several 
application-specific TTA processors designed using the TCE toolset.

Other feature highlights include (experimental) work group 
autovectorization (create vector instructions out of multiple
work-items) and a customized kernel buffer allocator.

Even though the OpenCL 1.2 standard is not yet implemented fully and
it contains known bugs, we now consider pocl ready for wider scale testing. 
pocl 0.6 compiles and runs successfully most of the Rodinia benchmark, 
all of ViennaCL test cases, and most of the OpenCL Programming Guide 
samples.
