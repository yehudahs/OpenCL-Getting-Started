Portable OpenCL (pocl) v0.7 released
------------------------------------

Portable OpenCL aims to be an efficient open source (MIT-licensed) 
implementation of the OpenCL 1.2 standard. 

In addition to producing an easily portable open source OpenCL
implementation, another major goal of the project is improving 
performance portability of OpenCL programs with compiler 
optimizations, reducing the need for target-dependent manual 
optimizations. 

At the core of pocl is the kernel compiler that consists of a 
set of LLVM passes used to statically generate multiple work-item
work group functions of kernels, even in the presence of work-group 
barriers. These functions are suitable for parallelization in multiple 
ways (SIMD, VLIW, superscalar,...).

This release adds support for LLVM 3.2, generating the work group
functions using simple (parallel) loop structures, fixes to make the
pocl work on ppc32, ppc64 and armv7. Initial Cell SPU support has also 
been added (very experimental!) to this release as an example of
an heterogeneous pocl device driver.

Even though the OpenCL 1.2 standard is not yet implemented fully and
it contains known bugs, we consider pocl ready for wider scale testing. 
The pocl 0.7 test suite compiles and runs most of the ViennaCL 1.3.1 examples, 
Rodinia 2.0.1 benchmarks, Parboil benchmarks, OpenCL Programming Guide book 
samples and the AMD APP SDK v2.8 OpenCL samples.
