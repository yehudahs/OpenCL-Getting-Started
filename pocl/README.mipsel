MIPS Little Endian
==================

With LLVM 3.7.0 plus a couple minor patches, almost all Little-endian MIPS32r2
tests from pocl's set pass.

Testing
-------

Tested on a Creator CI20 running 32-bit little-endian Debian Jessie with
the following cmake command:

    PATH=/path/to/clang-3.7.0-patched/bin/:$PATH CC=clang CXX=clang++ \
        cmake -GNinja ../pocl.src/ -DLLC_HOST_CPU=mips32r2
