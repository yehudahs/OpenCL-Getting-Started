  https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm-Device-Libs/ocml

Its purpose is to make it easy for device drivers to utilize
these builtin implementations if desired.

Please try to avoid modifications to the files under this
directory, but instead push the changes to ROCm-Device-Libs
first to keep the directory easier to synch with upstream.
